<p>Ok, This code is a study project made by myself with my own logic and with my own pressure haha, no one really asked me to do it, it is more for <b>studies</b>, so of course it may include some small problems, like the X<sub>2</sub> results being the inverse like, the result has to be -1 but then it be 1 for some reason.</p>

<p>
  Easy, When you enter the site you'll have an option write "bhaskara", if you wish to procee with bhaskara calculations, keep reading, if you wish to proceed with pythagorea theorem, <a href="#pythagoras">click here</a>.<br><br>
    Well, when you enter the page, you'll see that there's 3 letters, A, B and C, there are the places where you will put the respective numbers ( remmember that aX<sup>2</sup>+bX-c ), just put the numbers in their respective places, ( if there is any negative number, don't forget to add "-" in front of them like "-15".<br>
    When Finish, just click on the big blue box in the bottom called "show me the calculations" and then you'll be shown the whole calculations with the respective numbers you added! yeah, with the "delta" calculations, the "square root" and also the X<sub>1</sub> and X<sub>2</sub> as well! ( highlighted of course! )<br>
    If you wish to do another calculation or if you put the wrong numbers on them, just click on the blue box button in the bottom called "REDO" or press "F5" if you wish!
    <br>

    Well, Now about the pythagorean theorem:<br>
    Basically, when click on the option writen "bhaskara" will appear another option called "pythagorean theorem", so, just click on them!<br>
    When click, you'll get 2 places to put your respective numbers one called 'A' and another called 'B', so just put the respective numbers on each of them!<br>
    When finish, just click on the big blue box button called "show me the calculations" and you will got a page with the whole calculation of the pythagorean theorem with the respective numbers you added, and of course, the result is highlighted in the bottom!<br>
